#Experimental Testing of framework

This repository currently holds many individual subject-specific projects which are for testing the various parts of LibGDX's framework.
The various projects test sprite masking, animation, movement mechanics, box2d physics, cameras, and a plethora of other subjects.

Currently I have not made any games on my own with LibGDX but that will change soon ^_^
